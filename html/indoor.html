                        &emsp;&emsp; Not everyone enjoys leaving their Bonsai out in their garden, and not everyone has
                        the space to do so. Not only this, some people tend to enjoy the view of a beautiful miniature
                        tree growing inside the four walls of their own home. For his
                        reason, in this list, our team has compiled a list of the best Indoor Bonsai which does not tend
                        to require much sunlight. This also usually implies that the risk of infections are low as no
                        one enjoys having pests in their owm
                        home. Indoor Bonsais are typically less lessy and also tend to be more of an intermediate level
                        of Bonsai Art.

                    &emsp;&emsp; The Dwarf Jade is indigenous to the dry regions of South Africa. It is often sold as an
                    indoor bonsai. It can grow quite well inside the house as long as it is not overwatered and gets
                    enough sunlight.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; It is a fleshy, soft, woody small tree that has a thick trunk, but a fine
                    branch structure with thick green glossy oval-shaped succulent leaves which can have reddish
                    margins. The bark of younger plants is soft
                    and green which turns reddish brown with age. Dwarf jade plants are succulents, so they tend to be
                    drought-tolerant and prefer minimum watering. It is important to note that it should be watered only
                    when the soil looks completely
                    dry.

                    </div>&emsp;&emsp; The Fukien Tea is a subtropical evergreen shrub that is native to various parts
                    of Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, etc. It is an indoor bonsai tree. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; It develops a
                    greyish-beige fissured bark. The leaves
                    are small, and leathery and have little white hairs on their glossy surface. The flowers are
                    star-shaped, white, and small and grow in clusters. The fruits are round and turn red when they turn
                    ripe. Under deficient conditions, it
                    can suffer from spider mites, and whiteflies, which can be avoided or removed by using insecticides.
                    It is important to provide plenty of sunlight and it is recommended to be careful not to overwater
                    the plant because if the soil is
                    constantly wet, it also tends to harm the plant in the long run.

                    </div>
                    &emsp;&emsp; It is a popular indoor bonsai and is often produced in large quantities in South Asian
                    countries. It is great for classical landscapes or pen-jing. Its leaves are small, oval, and shiny.
                    In late summer, yellowish-white flower clusters can
                    develop, which is usually followed by tiny purple plum-shaped fruits. The bark is quite smooth and
                    dark brown with irregular patches peeling away, leaving light brown spots of young bark, which makes
                    the bark look very attractive.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; It does not tolerate frost and needs warm temperatures even during winter.
                    Although it is often acquired by beginners, insufficient watering often causes problems. They are
                    susceptible to mealy bugs underneath
                    the shedding bark, which can be extracted using tweezers to preserve the treeâ€™s appearance.

                    &emsp;&emsp; Ficus thrives in an indoor environment. Ficus retusa and Ficus ginseng, both have
                    visually interesting trunks and can be grown inside.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; They are adaptable because of their ability to respond positively to growing
                    restrictions. Since ficus trees are content in smaller containers, they're well suited to bonsai.
                    They're also forgiving of lapses in
                    watering and other types of care. Ficus plants don't mind the dry conditions of indoor environments,
                    but it is recommended to choose a sunny spot for the bonsai. They are also quite resistant to pests
                    and other infections.

                    </div>
                    &emsp;&emsp; Money trees are evergreen broadleaf trees with hand-shaped compound leaves. The large
                    compound leaves, long stems, and the growth characteristics of the plant, which rarely develops real
                    branches, make it difficult to make it a proper bonsai.
                    This bonsai is popular for its affiliation with luck and wealth.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Money trees often have a slightly swollen trunk base, which serves as water
                    storage, and the bark is brownish. The long brown woody fruits of this bonsai contain seeds that can
                    be roasted and eaten as a snack.
                    If they have braided trunks, they often crush each other and cause problems. It is better to choose
                    a plant with a single trunk or to undo the braids to avoid such problems.
