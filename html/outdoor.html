                        &emsp;&emsp; Not everyone enjoys leaving their Bonsai inside their house, and not everyone has
                        the space to do so. Not only this, some people tend to enjoy the view of a beautiful miniature
                        tree growing outside in the garden of their own homes. For this
                        reason, in this list, our team has compiled a list of the best Outdoor Bonsai which can be left
                        out in the sunlight the whole day. They usually survive even with little water and require a lot
                        of sunlight.

                    &emsp;&emsp; Privets are small trees or shrubs which can grow in most kinds of soil. It is often
                    used for making hedges, which can be a good thick-trunked Bonsai. It is a strong plant that takes
                    bonsai styling techniques (like trimming and bending with
                    wires) very well and is also a good choice for beginners with little experience.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; The leaves are oval and opposite and the flowers are small and white. They
                    appear at the tips of new shoots in summer and are typically followed by small black fruit which is
                    moderately poisonous. The privet prefers
                    a place with direct sunlight for at least part of the day. Aphids, whiteflies, and weevils(a type of
                    beetle) can attack the plant, but this problem can be controlled with insecticides.

                    &emsp;&emsp; The Japanese Maple is native to Japan, Korea, and other southeast Asian countries.
                    These trees are very popular as ornamental shrubs. Maples are known and loved for their attractive
                    colors in different shades of yellow, orange, and red.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; It is a shrub-like slender tree. The leaves are divided into five to eleven
                    pointed lobes, often with toothed edges. The newer leaves have a yellowish or orange to bright red
                    color. It has hand-shaped leaves with
                    five or more pointed lobes. The bark starts off green or reddish which turns light grey with age.
                    The reddish flowers tend to appear in clusters from May to June.

                    </div>
                    &emsp;&emsp; These trees are deciduous and have a grayish-colored bark. It can be kept indoors, but
                    most often it grows best when placed outside. It is ideal for bonsai art because its leaves and
                    internodes reduce well when trimmed, which is a key method
                    of bonsai keeping.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; These trees grow in a thin twig-like structure. The fruits are edible and
                    bright orange, while the leaves are oval-shaped. It thrives when kept outdoors, but with proper care
                    and maintenance, it will also grow
                    indoors. They provide both fruits (between March and April) and flowers (between September and
                    October).

                    </div>
                    &emsp;&emsp; The Japanese Winterberry is an outdoor plant. Fall and winter are endorsed as the best
                    seasons for this bonsai as the light gray bark and bright red berries create an attractive sight.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; They need a lot of sunlight for producing their fruit but should be protected
                    from intense heat and sun during the hottest summer days. The bright red berries, which emerge from
                    small pink flowers are its most
                    notable feature. Its small leaves turn yellow and then to varying shades of red and purple in
                    autumn.

                    <div class="asset">
                        <img src="../images/outdoor/bougainvillea.jpg">
                    </div>
                    &emsp;&emsp; Bougainvilleas are fast-growing and are well suited for most bonsai styles as they can
                    tolerate pruning and trimming very well. They also take well to wiring so it can be formed into
                    different shapes without much trouble.
                    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Although they are not difficult to grow, it is best to make sure they are fully
                    exposed to the sun. It needs a lot of sunlight and high temperatures for producing flowers and so,
                    it should be placed outside in
                    a sunny place during the growing season. In autumn, the tree should be kept in a cool room with
                    sufficient light (or under grow lights). They produce bright colors of flowers, which are often
                    yellow, pink, and orange. It tends to be
                    pest resistant as long as is kept healthy and free from very wet soil or lack of sunlight.
