                            <b style="font-size: 24px;">What is the best bonsai for a beginner?</b>
                            <br> People new to the art of bonsai often ask us this question. The answer is - it depends!
                            Success with bonsai depends on two important things: location and watering. Having said
                            that, some species of tree are certainly more
                            manageable than others.
                            <br> Bonsai trees are suitable for any home, and they are also great for someone who is not
                            used to caring for a garden. When you start with bonsai, you tend to want to keep them in
                            the house. After all, they are houseplants.
                            You won't see them as much as you would if they were on the coffee table/desk. Some bonsai
                            plants can be kept indoors, and people tend to start with these.
                        </li>

                            <b style="font-size: 24px;">What is the meaning of bonsai?</b>
                            <br> The word “Bon-sai” (often misspelled as Bonzai or Banzai) is a Japanese term that when
                            translated, means “planted in a container”. This was derived from an ancient Chinese
                            horticultural practice, which was then redeveloped
                            under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism.
                            <br> It has been around for well over a thousand years. The ultimate goal of growing a
                            Bonsai is to create a miniaturized as well as realistic representation of nature in the form
                            of a tree. Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed
                            plants any tree species can be used to grow a bonsai.

                            <b style="font-size: 24px;">How often should I water my bonsai?</b>
                            <br> Approximately once a week or so, when the topsoil feels completely dry, immerse the
                            entire bonsai plant in a bucket or basin of water until all the air bubbles have risen to
                            the top. Humidity is an important consideration
                            for the health of the bonsai.

                            <b style="font-size: 24px;">Why is bonsai so expensive?</b>
                            <br> Bonsai creation is an art form. Taking care of a bonsai is very labor intensive and
                            often requires skilled workers. There is a low supply of good quality bonsai. It is usually
                            a long-term investment as they can survive
                            for many years.

                            <br> The first step to take in case of an undelivered product is to contact us through the

                            simply informing or notifying us of this
                            error. If there is no reply from us, it could be due to the holiday season, so please be

                            <br> You can track your shipment using our website or one of our online portals. Usually, we
                            send you a link to track your shipment through your email or messages. Please wait until the
                            order has been confirmed to check for
                            the delivery tracking number, as it will be included in the same file.

                            <br> You may request returns for most items you buy from BONSAIA. However, you can only
                            return items explicitly identified as "returnable" on the product detail with a valid
                            reason. Any damaged items will NOT be refunded.

                            <br> The processing time for your order depends on several things: the type of order,
                            whether your order is in stock, and when you place it. Usually, it takes about 1-2 business
                            days for the order confirmation email. The details
                            of the delivery, including the expected arrival, are included in the email or message.

                            <br> You can change your delivery address if your order has not been shipped or delivered
                            yet. We recommend informing us immediately if the address is incorrect or has been changed.
                            If your order is already in transit, additional
                            charges may or may not be added depending on the situation. Please contact us directly for
